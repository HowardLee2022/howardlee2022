## Hello!

A recent graduate from a Full Stack Development Bootcamp at University of Washington. I enjoy problem solving and learning new skills. My skills include Javascript (Node.Js, React.js), HTML, CSS, SQL/noSQL/Mongodb

I'm currently looking for opportunities in Web Development and Junior software development where I can expand my knowledge and grow as a developer
